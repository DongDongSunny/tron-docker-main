# TRON Docker

This repository provides tools and guidance to help the community quickly get started with the TRON network and development.

## Features

### üöÄ Quick start for single FullNode
Easily deploy a single TRON FullNode connected to **Mainnet** or **Nile testnet** using Docker. Follow the instructions to get your node up and running in minutes.

### üîó Private chain setup
Set up your own private TRON blockchain network for development and testing. The provided configurations simplify deployment and management, making it ideal for custom use cases.

### üìä Node monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
Monitor the health and performance of your TRON nodes with integrated **Prometheus** and **Grafana** services. Real-time metrics and visualizations are just a few steps away.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools
We also provide tools to facilitate the CI and testing process:
- **Gradle Docker**: Automate the build and testing of the `java-tron` Docker image using Gradle.
- **DBFork**: Launch a private java-tron network based on the Mainnet database state, enabling shadow fork testing.

## Prerequisites
Please download and install the latest version of Docker from the official Docker website:
* Docker Installation for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* Docker Installation for [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/)


## Quick start
To quickly start a fullnode that connect to the Mainnet, simply download and run [docker-compose-quick-start.yml](single_node/docker-compose-quick-start.yml):
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose-quick-start.yml up
```
Once the FullNode starts, it will begin to sync blocks with Mainnet from the genesis block.

You can use `docker exec tron-node tail -f ./logs/tron.log` to check the logs. For more details, please refer to the [single_node](single_node/README.md) section.

## Start all features
First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-docker.git
cd tron-docker
```

### Start feature by Trond script
We provide a Trond script to help developers easily start features with a single command, enabling the community to quickly engage in TRON network development and interaction.

```sh
./trond -h
Usage:
  trond [command]

Examples:
# Help information for java-tron Docker image build and testing commands
$ ./trond docker

# Help information for database snapshot download-related commands
$ ./trond snapshot

# Help information for TRON single FullNode deployment commands
$ ./trond node

Available Commands:
  docker      Commands for operating the java-tron Docker image.
  help        Help about any command
  node        Commands for operating the java-tron Docker node.
  snapshot    Commands for obtaining java-tron node snapshots.
```
Check the output of `./trond -h`, which now supports the following features:
- Deploy a single FullNode for various networks.
- Build and test the java-tron Docker image.
- Download database snapshots.

### Start the feature individually
To start all available features, navigate to the appropriate directory and follow the instructions in the corresponding README to start the services:
- **TRON network deployment related:**
   - **Single FullNode**: Use the [single_node](./single_node) folder.
   - **Private TRON network**: Use the [private_net](./private_net) folder.
   - **Node monitoring**: Use the [metric_monitor](./metric_monitor) folder.

- **Tools**:
   - **Gradle Docker**: Automate Docker image builds and testing. Check the [gradle docker](./tools/docker/README.md) documentation.
   - **DBFork**: Perform shadow fork testing. Follow the [DBFork guidance](./tools/dbfork/README.md).
