# TRON Docker

This repository provides tools and guidance to help the community quickly get started with the TRON network and development.

## Features

### üöÄ Quick start for single FullNode
Easily deploy a single TRON FullNode connected to **Mainnet** or **Nile testnet** using Docker. Follow the instructions to get your node up and running in minutes.

### üîó Private chain setup
Set up your own private TRON blockchain network for development and testing. The provided configurations simplify deployment and management, making it ideal for custom use cases.

### üìä Node monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
Monitor the health and performance of your TRON nodes with integrated **Prometheus** and **Grafana** services. Real-time metrics and visualizations are just a few steps away.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools
We also provide tools to facilitate the CI and testing process:
- **Gradle Docker**: Automate the build and testing of the `java-tron` Docker image using Gradle.
- **DBFork**: Launch a private java-tron network based on the Mainnet database state, enabling shadow fork testing.

## Prerequisites
Please download and install the latest version of Docker from the official Docker website:
* Docker Installation for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* Docker Installation for [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* Docker Installation for [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/)


## Quick Start
To quickly start a fullnode that connect to the Mainnet, please download and run [docker-compose-quick-start.yml](single_node/docker-compose-quick-start.yml):

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-quick-start.yml up
```
Once the fullnode starts, it will begin to sync blocks with other peers starting from genesis block.
You could use `docker exec tron-node tail -f ./logs/tron.log` to check the logs. For more details usage please refer [single_node](single_node/README.md) part.

## Start services easily through script

## Start the service separately
First clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-docker.git
cd tron-docker
```

Then, navigate to the relevant directory and follow the instructions in the respective README to start the servicesÔºö
- **TRON network deployment related:**
   - **Single FullNode**: Use the [single_node](./single_node) folder.
   - **Private TRON network**: Use the [private_net](./private_net) folder.
   - **Node monitoring**: Use the [metric_monitor](./metric_monitor) folder.

- **Tools**:
   - **Gradle Docker**: Automate Docker image builds and testing. Check the [gradle docker](./tools/docker/README.md) documentation.
   - **DBFork**: Perform shadow fork testing. Follow the [DBFork guidance](./tools/dbfork/README.md).
